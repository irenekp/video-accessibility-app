#  VIDEO ACCESSIBILITY [ANDROID]

an android app for all your video accessibility needs.

Supporting Application to test our heavy-computation-offloading framework - [DICE](https://github.com/irenekp/computation-offloading-framework)

## About
Given the wide-spread increase of video-based content on the internet, it is very important to ensure accessibility of this content to the larger internet user-base. This app provides a quick interface to add video subtitles/transcrits and descrptions/captions to improve content accessibility to those who are visual and hearing-impaired. 
It also provides options to compress the video to enable sharing over platforms, bandwidth and devices with lower capacity - thus promoting reach. Given the computationally intensive nature of these tasks, the app uses an in-build computation offloading engine (DICE) to make a context-based decision on whether to offload the task to our server.

### Performance
Video processing functions like visual description, subtitling and compression are very time consuming processes and mobile phones are resource-limit devices. Our app offers the ability to dynamically, based on context, decide whether a task is better off offloaded into a remote server. Below are the performance metrics on the time and power consumption for the video processing activites covered in the app when done locally on the device vs remotely on a server.
