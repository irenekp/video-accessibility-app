## About
Given the wide-spread increase of video-based content on the internet, it is very important to ensure accessibility of this content to the larger internet user-base. This app provides a quick interface to add video subtitles/transcrits and descrptions/captions to improve content accessibility to those who are visual and hearing-impaired. 
It also provides options to compress the video to enable sharing over platforms, bandwidth and devices with lower capacity - thus promoting reach. Given the computationally intensive nature of these tasks, the app uses an in-build computation offloading engine (DICE) to make a context-based decision on whether to offload the task to our server.
